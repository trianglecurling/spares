# Questions and Clarifications for Triangle Curling Spares

## Authentication & User Management

1. **Multiple users with same contact info**: When multiple members share an email or phone (e.g., parents and children), 
   after entering the 6-digit code, users can select which member profile to log in as. Is this the intended behavior?

2. **First-time user registration**: The spec mentions users can "log in" using email/phone, but what happens if someone 
   tries to log in who isn't in the system? Should there be a self-registration flow, or must all members be added by 
   administrators first?

3. **Contact information requirements**: Should members be required to have at least one contact method (email or phone)? 
   Can a member have both or just one?

## Spare Request Matching

4. **Private request member visibility**: For private spare requests, should regular (non-admin) members be able to see 
   a list of all members to invite? Currently, only admins can see the full member list. Should we create a separate 
   "member directory" feature?

5. **Position matching**: When someone requests a spare for "skip" position, should we ONLY notify members who marked 
   themselves as comfortable skipping? Currently, yes. Or should we notify all available members and just highlight the 
   position requirement?

6. **Multiple responses to requests**: Currently, the first person to respond gets the spot and the request is marked 
   as filled. Should requesters be able to see all responses and choose, or is first-come-first-served preferred?

## League & Availability

7. **League overlap**: Can leagues have overlapping schedules? For example, if there are two leagues on the same day 
   at the same time, how should we handle availability?

8. **Partial availability**: Should members be able to specify they're available for only certain draw times within 
   a league, or is it all-or-nothing for each league?

9. **League changes mid-season**: If an admin changes league details (e.g., draw times), should existing availability 
   be preserved or reset? Should members be notified of changes?

## Notifications

10. **Email/SMS delivery failures**: How should the system handle failed email or SMS deliveries? Should there be 
    admin notifications, retry logic, or logging?

11. **Notification preferences**: Should members be able to set separate preferences for different types of 
    notifications (e.g., email for spare requests but SMS for filled requests)?

12. **Notification timing**: Should there be any throttling or batching of notifications? For example, if someone 
    creates 5 spare requests in quick succession, should members get 5 separate emails or one digest?

## Administrative Functions

13. **Member deletion**: When an admin deletes a member, what should happen to their historical spare requests and 
    responses? Currently using CASCADE delete. Should we keep historical data?

14. **Bulk operations**: Would it be helpful to have bulk import/export features for members and leagues (e.g., CSV import)?

15. **Admin notifications**: Should admins receive notifications when new spare requests are created, when members 
    join/leave, or other system events?

## User Experience

16. **Past requests**: Should members be able to view a history of past (filled/cancelled) spare requests beyond 
    their own? For reporting or transparency?

17. **Edit spare requests**: Should requesters be able to edit details of an open spare request, or only cancel 
    and create a new one?

18. **Request expiration**: Should spare requests automatically expire after the game date/time has passed? 
    Currently they remain "open" indefinitely if not filled.

## Technical

19. **Database migrations**: Is there a need for a more sophisticated migration system, or is the current simple 
    schema creation sufficient for this application?

20. **Rate limiting**: Should there be rate limiting on authentication attempts or API requests to prevent abuse?

21. **Analytics/Reporting**: Are there any reporting needs for admins (e.g., most active members, spare request 
    fill rates, league participation)?

22. **Testing**: Should automated tests be created? If so, what level of coverage is desired (unit, integration, e2e)?

## Azure & Twilio Configuration

23. **Email sender verification**: Has the Azure Communication Services sender email (noreply@tccnc.club) been 
    verified in Azure?

24. **Twilio phone number**: Has a Twilio phone number been provisioned and configured for SMS sending?

25. **Service quotas**: Are there any sending limits or quotas we need to be aware of for Azure Communication 
    Services or Twilio?

## Future Enhancements

26. **Mobile app**: Is there interest in a native mobile app in the future, or will the responsive web app suffice?

27. **Calendar integration**: Would members find it useful to have spare requests added to their calendar (iCal/Google Calendar)?

28. **Team management**: Should there be features for managing teams/rosters within leagues?

29. **Payment/Credit system**: Any plans for tracking who spares for whom, or a credit/reciprocity system?

30. **Multi-club support**: Is this intended to be used only by Triangle Curling, or should it support multiple clubs?
